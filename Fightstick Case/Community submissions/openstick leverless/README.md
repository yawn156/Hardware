Leverless open stick layout, putting this on hold for some time but here are the current files.
You NEED the acrylic layer to give this some rigidity because I lowered the height of the plates and they bow down when pressed at the middle, 3mm acrylic sheet should be fine but I didn't get to test it myself so be warned.


Printing settings should be the same as the main one, you could make the top plates with 100% infill to make them sturdier as well.
